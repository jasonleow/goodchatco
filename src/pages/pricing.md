          Ideally, we need 2-4 weeks to find the respondents for you. Simpler
          profiles 2 weeks, harder profiles might need longer. For rush jobs
          (anything less than 2 weeks), we will explore with you to see if it is
          possible to find respondents fast enough. Rush jobs (i.e. less than 2
          weeks but at least 1 week in advance) also mean that we need to charge
          more for it. Please refer to FAQ 4 on our rates.
        question: How much lead time do you need for recruitment?
      - answer: >-
          The date when job was confirmed (by 12pm) would be considered Day 1 to
          the date that you require us to submit the confirmed respondents.
        question: How do you calculate the lead time?
      - answer: >-
          If you require us to provide a confirmed list of respondents upfront –
          say you need to see all 40 of confirmed respondents name, background,
          details before you interview them - we will need more lead time to
          recruit the entire batch. But if you are flexible with that, or if you
          foresee it might change, we will provide the respondent details one by
          one as and when they are found, or in batches. This reduces the lead
          time needed, e.g. we can for example, find the first 5 users for you
          first, have a regroup after the 5 interviews to ascertain if you need
          to change any profiles, then continue to find the remaining profiles.
          Sometimes the clients we work with might need to change the profiles
          along the way, so that prevents you from incurring surcharges since
          upfront confirmation means work done.
        question: >-
          Can I see a list of all the respondents you confirmed before I proceed
          with my design research?
      - answer: >-
          We will find only one, best fit respondent for each profile. Unlike
          typical consumer research firms who will provide multiple options per
          profile, we find that that adds a lot more cost to the client. Hence,
          to help minimize cost to you, we will provide only 1 candidate per
          profile. All these is of course done in discussion with you, whether
          the candidate is indeed best fit.
        question: >-
          How many alternative respondents will you provide for each user
          profile?
      - answer: >-
          Our price per user is in a range between S$300 – S$700, depending on
          the following factors : lead time and complexity of the the profile.


          **i. Lead Time**


          For rush jobs (i.e. less than 2 weeks but at least 1 week in advance)
          - $500 per successful profile. In cases, where sufficient lead time is
          given and non-complex case, the rate would be $300 per successful
          profile.


          **ii. Complexity**


          A user in the $300 range will be generic and relatively easy to find,
          e.g. working professional in 30s in finance sector. Someone in the
          $500 range would be a lot more specific/niche, e.g. C-suite banking
          professional for high net worth clients, with 20 years of experience
          and other unique characteristics. Cost will go up if the profiles
          becomes more specific, niche, rare to find. Other factors that might
          result in increase in cost are (but not exhaustive) – C-suite or very
          senior in position, industry veteran/content expert, not mainstream
          (e.g. someone with a rare disability), where a user profile includes
          more than 3 behavioural traits combined (therefore making it very
          specific/niche to find), more than 5 users of the same profile needed.
          We will advise on the costs on a case-by-case basis where changes are
          needed.


          **_In situations where lead time_ is short and profiles are _complex
          and niche_, our rates would be $700 per successful profile.**
        question: How do you charge for each user profile?
      - answer: >-
          There’s no cost to changing the profiles to suit your changing
          research needs, as long as the changes don’t make it more difficult to
          find. So there are some caveats. Changing the user profile after the
          user had already been found will unfortunately be counted as work
          done. Cost will go up if the profiles becomes more specific, niche,
          rare to find. Other factors that might result in increase in cost are
          (but not exhaustive) – C-suite or very senior in position, industry
          veteran/content expert, not mainstream (e.g. someone with a rare
          disability), where a user profile includes more than 3 behavioural
          traits combined (therefore making it very specific/niche to find),
          more than 5 of the same profile needed. We will advise on the costs on
          a case-by-case basis where changes are needed.
        question: Are there any costs to user profile changes?
      - answer: >-
          Most of the time, we will tap on our own networks to source for users.
          But sometimes your research might require speaking to users whom only
          you/the company have access to (e.g. a customer who interacted with a
          specific service whom we won’t be able to know due to client
          confidentiality). In these cases, we will need to work with you to
          find them and coordinate with the internal stakeholders who might be
          involved. So some effort might be needed on your part.
        question: What is my involvement in the user recruitment?
      - answer: >-
          We will arrange for an alternative time and date to meet the
          respondent. But if the respondent is not able to make it for any other
          dates, we will need to source for a new respondent to be interviewed
          at a different time. What this means is there will be a surcharge for
          you – as work had already been done and interview fixed, we will need
          to calculate the new respondent as an additional user. We will also
          need at least 1-2 weeks to find a replacement. We try our best to
          prevent this from happening by working with you to ensure there are no
          schedule conflicts.
        question: >-
          What if an interview had already been fixed and at the last minute, I
          cannot attend?
