          As design consultants ourselves, we have a deep appreciation of the
          challenges of design research and the behavioural nuances required in
          each user profile you speak to. We understand the difficulties (and
          importance) in finding the right user to interview, which is why we
          typically like to collaborate closely with you to explore how we can
          find the best fit profile for your research needs. What this entails
          is that we might hold brainstorming sessions to learn more about your
          design research objectives; what you’re trying to learn from each
          profile; how the research feeds into the subsequent design phases.
          When we can understand what you’re trying to achieve, we are able to
          recommend interesting and relevant user profiles that we might not
          have originally thought of.

          We take a more qualitative approach in our screening processes. We do
          so by asking open-ended questions and questions on their personal
          journeys and stories based on the context of the research to assess
          suitability for the research. We will interpret and calibrate the
          profiles and provide contextual information to aid the team in your
          selection of users for the research.

          Often times, your design research might throw up new issues to explore
          which in turn change the original scope of the user profiles. The
          conventional consumer research way of upfront confirmation of users
          might not work for you. What we learned from our customers (and also
          from our own work as designers!) is that they need to be able to
          change the behavioural attributes/characteristics of the user profiles
          along the way, and therefore recruitment has to be flexible and
          adaptive. Our pricing allows for updates and responsive changes, as
          your research changes.
